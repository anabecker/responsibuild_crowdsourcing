    <h2>Welcome to the Alpha version of Responsibuild's crowdsourcing web app!</h2>
  </header>
<!-- Article's Header Element Ends Here -->  
<!--<p>Thanks for visiting our site and joining our project! Our goal is to create a single website where homeowners and communities can come find ways to sustainably rebuild after a disaster, or build anytime. We came together in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York City, after working for various volunteer projects, and came to one conclusion. There wasn't a single place that the public could go, to learn about every facet of rebuilding in a sustainable way. There are many sites, and there is a lot of info out there, and during a disaster, the last thing you have time for, is spending hours online trying to find how to fix your flooded basement. You want answers, you want them quick, and you want it to be right.</p>
<p><strong>That's where you come in!</strong></p>
</p>After spending some time trying to gather the data ourselves, we realized very quickly why a project of this importance has never been done. There is a mountain of data to sift through, and it's not possible to do it with a small centralized team. So, we are going to let anyone who wants post information on how to sustainably rebuild. If you have any experience in building or volunteering, please leave your knowledge here. As this community continues to grow, we plan on making it a killer network, that will allow people to keep in touch, ask questions, and organize during disasters. So again, post what you can, and invite people to do the same!</p>-->
<!--   <p>Thanks for visiting the site! Responsibuild's goal is to build a website where people anywhere, whether they are homeowners, volunteers, or experts in their field, can come and share information on how to best rebuild after a disaster. This effort came out of a tech meetup after Hurricane Sandy in NYC...</p> -->

 <h3>About Responsibuild:</h3>

 <p>Helping disaster victims recover in an economic and ecologically sustainable way.</p>

<p>After the storm, the victims of Hurricane Sandy and other natural disasters inevitably have to rebuild.  Your home is where the heart is…why not use this opportunity to create a healthier, more sustainable living space?</p>

<p>Our Responsibuild hub will showcase best practices ranging from rebuilding your basement with better materials to what kind of mold-resistant paint to buy when you go to your local store.</p>

<p>Responsibuild will allow you to take your life back into your own hands.</p>

<p>We leverage the expertise of organizations like The US Green Building Council, The Salvation Army’s Envirenew program, Nyserda, Architecture for Humanity, Make It Right Foundation, and case studies in design, architecture and engineering to help you navigate the crowded space of building materials.   Our contributors are collaborating to crowdsource the best answers to the hardest questions.  We attempt to be as transparent as possible with our processes and welcome any and all voices.</p>

<p>By building and managing this site, we’ll help drive those of you in the recovery and rebuilding stages to the best options for sustainably reconstructing your home and community in the best way both ecologically and economically.</p>

    <h2>How to use this site (quick and easy instructions)</h2>
  </header>
<!-- Article's Header Element Ends Here -->  
  <p>Most simply, click log in on the top right, and enter your info. After you are logged in, a button that says "Add Post" will appear next to the Log In/Log Out button. Click "Add Post" to add a post with a title, comma separated categories, and text information about whatever subject you would like to contribute to.</p>
  <p>In addition to adding posts, you can click to view our timeline, which is already on the left of your screen. This is a timeline of all posts so far, in descending order. Above, you can click organizations, to see all organizations that members have mentioned being a part of. Then contacts, which gives you a list of all contributers. And finally categories, which shows you a list of all tags. The rest of the buttons are pretty straighforward.</p>

    <h2>Recent Changes to the site, and what comes next</h2>
  </header>
<!-- Article's Header Element Ends Here -->  
  <p>Version 2! Updated 12/23/12</p> 
  <ul>
  <li>Updated the about page.</li>
  <li>Added maps! Using <a href="leafletjs.com">leafletjs</a> you can now see a point on the map for each organizations landing page. I also added a "Maps" button, which you can click and, for now, see all listed organizations on a map. There will be much more mapping in the near future.</li>
  <li>Added a member home page. For now it just lists your personal info which we have on file, and asks you to fill in basic info on your organizations, if you haven't yet done so.</li>
  <li>Added more information on the organization landing page.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Version 3! Updated 12/24/12</p> 
  <ul>
  <li>You can now vote up or vote down a post. In the background, the app makes sure that you don't add more than one, or subtract more than one from a post. But if you hit "1+", and meant "1-", you can hit one minus twice, and add a cumulative -1 to the post.</li>
  <li>More info on the contacts pages</li>
  <li>Anyone can now flag a post as inappropriate. After review, we can add it or delete it, and we have the member info of whoever posted it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Next version</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Much more with maps!</li>
  <li>Add plus one and minus one to comments as well</li>
  <li>Allow a user to accrue reputation points, when someone uses 1+, 1- on one of their posts/comments</li>
  <li>Same javascript goodness, to make the site more friendly and to save our server some CPU time</li>
  <li>Allow a user to edit and delete their own posts/comments</li>
  <li>More information on a user's member page</li>
  <li>Continue to work on the sessions software</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the medium and long term, we plan on making this a killer platform to share ideas with one another, and soon after, the public. After we gather data on a subject here, we plan on having an expert curate that data, and then post the curated page for a comment period, where we can collaboratively improve that page. After that is over, we will post it on our main page, for people everywhere to use. We can't wait to see how this project grows, and we hope you're excited too! Thanks again for using the site, check back often, and tell lots of people about the site!"
