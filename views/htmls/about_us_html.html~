<h3>About Responsibuild</h3>
<p>Responsibuild came out of a tech meetup in Manhattan in early December of 2012. Our goal is to create a single website where homeowners and communities can come find ways to sustainably rebuild after a disaster, or build anytime. We came together in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York City, after working for various volunteer projects, and came to one conclusion. There wasn't a single place that the public could go, to learn about every facet of rebuilding in a sustainable way. There are many sites, and there is a lot of info out there, and during a disaster, the last thing you have time for, is spending hours online trying to find how to fix your flooded basement. You want answers, you want them quick, and you want it to be right.</p>
